# Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Software Development
Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! These repository documents are for Task 4 of my internship journey, which focuses on creating innovative, simple, flexible programs.

# Task Overview
Create a program that solves Sudoku puzzles automatically. The program should take an input grid representing an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and use an algorithm to fill in the missing numbers.
It should use backtracking or other suitable techniques to explore possible solutions and find the correct arrangement of numbers for the puzzle. Once solved, the program should display the completed Sudoku grid.

# Knowledge Gained
Task 4 improved my gaming programming thought process and developed it without any confusion.
